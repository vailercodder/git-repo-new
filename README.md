to write a story together 

## The story:
our story ~~ends~~ ==starts==
with us trying to figure out how to operate 
the bash terminal in vcs


### The challenges we faced along the way:smile:: 

we faced alot of challenges while starting this project, we didnt had
alot of practical history with coding in vcs or using github, but none
the less we managed to publish or project working together 
and we found out, that the problems we faced along and the mistakes me made
were the  best part of the work!
